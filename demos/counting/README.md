# Counting Demo

* https://www.w3.org/Data/demos/chunks/counting/

This demo is borrowed from a tutorial for the popular Cognitive Science architecture ACT-R. The demo serves as an introduction to chunks and rules.

It generates a sequence of digits by counting up from an start value and ends with a finish value. This is done using three rules. One to commence the counting task, a second rule to advance to the next digit, and a third rule to terminate the task after reaching the target value. The demo recalls chunks from the facts module that give the successor digit, e.g. 5 comes after 4.

An extended version of this demo could be developed to count beyond 9 with further rules and facts that support tens, hundreds and thousands etc.
