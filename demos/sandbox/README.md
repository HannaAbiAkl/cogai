# Sandbox for experimenting with Chunks in your browser

This is a browser based sandbox for exploring tutorials and experimenting with chunks and rules for yourself. You can edit the goal, facts and rules in the web page, and optionally save the work locally using the browser's local storage API. The sandbox allows you to single step through the application of rules, and see how the chunk buffers and variable bindings are effected.

The plan is to expand the set of tutorials with your help!
