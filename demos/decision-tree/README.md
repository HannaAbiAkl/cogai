# Decision Tree Demo

* https://www.w3.org/Data/demos/chunks/decision-tree/

This demo is borrowed from an old tutorial for ID3, and decides whether the weather is suitable for playing a game of golf. The weather conditions are randomly generated. The demo just uses the rules module with a decision tree implemented as a succession of rules. A future demo will cover machine learning of decision trees from examples. This will be followed by a suite of demos exploring machine learning of declararive and procedural knowledge, including the use of imagination/planning, case-based reasoning, and hierarchical reinforcement learning.
